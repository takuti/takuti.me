  <p>
  This page summarizes my study notes and their implementations. I am very interested in <span class="bold">Artificial Intelligence</span>, <span class="bold">Machine Learning</span> and <span class="bold">Complexity</span> because they are technologically and scientifically exciting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe most of the contents are related to these exciting topics. However, I am also interested in other computer science topics, so the contents cover them too.

  <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
  <p>
  I have studied an introduction to machine learning at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">one of the online courses in Coursera</a>. I will summarize some key concepts of this course and implement them by myself in <span class="bold">Python</span> for advanced studies. This content is comming soon...

  <h3>Web Development</h3>
  <p>
    It is very exciting for engineers to run own applications. In particular, web development is easy to understand an output by intuition and has graphically stimulating, so I love web development.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am interested in <a href="https://angularjs.org/"><span class="bold">AngularJS</span></a> and <span class="bold">HTML5 Canvas</span> recently. The former provides an awesome user experience, and the latter is stimulating in terms of visualization.
