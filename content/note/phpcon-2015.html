<p>I have attended <a href="http://phpcon.php.gr.jp/2015/">phpcon2015</a>, Japan PHP Conference 2015, on October 3.</p>
<p><img src="/images/jekyll/2015-10-04-phpcon.jpg" alt="phpcon"></p>
<p>As you know, this year is very important for PHP users, because PHP7 will be released very soon. So, the theme of this PHP conference is <strong><em>7</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Though this was my first experience of attending large-scale conference in a cool geek community, I really enjoyed many exciting talks. Basically, I listened invited foreign speakers&#39; talk, and all of them provided super favorable knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Cperformance-testing-modern-apps%E2%80%9D-dustinwhittle-https-twitter-com-dustinwhittle">“Performance Testing Modern Apps” <a href="https://twitter.com/dustinwhittle">@dustinwhittle</a></h3>
<p>He introduced many useful performance testing tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://testutils.org/multi-mechanize/">Multi-Mechanize</a></li>
<li><a href="http://locust.io">LOCUST</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns">Bees with Machine Guns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.webpagetest.org">WEBPAGETEST</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sitespeed.io">sitespeed.io</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;<strong><em>Automate performance testing, and treat performance as a feature</em></strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Next, this was great introduction to how programming languages work (not only PHP). Today, a wide variety of engineers/designers use PHP, and some of them actually do not have computer science background. Hence, this kind of fundamental knowledge is valuable.</p>
<p>Also, we were really surprised his latest work in Python, called <a href="https://github.com/juokaz/pyhp">PyHP</a>, to implement PHP with JIT support.</p>
<h3 id="%E2%80%9Cdatabase-theory-models-and-abstractions%E2%80%9D-etc-https-twitter-com-etc">“Database Theory Models and Abstractions” <a href="https://twitter.com/etc">@etc</a></h3>
<p>His presentation was technologically and visually stimulating. Well-organized 20-minute talk and attractive pictures were effective way to tell confusing database theories.</p>
<p>I understood how learning theoretical aspects of database is an important thing to efficiently manage our massive, complex data.</p>

<p>Previously, I was just curious about PHP as a tool to develop web applications. However, thanks to Rasmus&#39;s passionate keynote and all contents in phpcon2015, now I am also interested in PHP as one programming language. Again, PHP7 will be released very soon, around the end of October or beginning of November!</p>
<p>In fact, I first used PHP more than 4 years before, but there are still lots of things I don&#39;t know. Hence, this conference was good opportunity for me to understand past, present and future of PHP.</p>
