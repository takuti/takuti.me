<p>Following <a href="http://phpcon.php.gr.jp/2015/">phpcon2015</a>, I have attended <a href="https://pycon.jp/2015/en/">PyCon JP 2015</a> at the end of last week.</p>

<p><img src="/images/jekyll/2015-10-13-pycon-entrance.jpg" alt="pycon-entrance" /></p>

<p>Although I have more than 8-year programming experience, I first write Python code only a year ago. However, despite the really short-term experience, now Python is definitely one of my most favorite programming languages. I use Python in many different purposes such as research, private projects, part-time job, and competitive programming.</p>

<p>My usage scenes of Python is really wide-ranging, right? Actually, the theme of PyCon JP 2015 was <strong><em>Possibilities of Python</em></strong>, and everyone agrees with its possibilities. Also, <a href="https://pycon.jp/2015/en/schedule/">the conference schedule</a> clearly illustrates possibilities of Python; we can see a wide variety of talks: hardware-related (robotics, FPGA), web development, data science and machine learning.</p>

<p>Due to too much conference contents, summarizing them one-by-one is hard for me. So, I just list some GitHub repositories based on my stars during the conference:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">getsentry / sentry</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Keynote talk focused on Python technologies around error/crash reporting.</li>
      <li>Highly practical and interesting keynote.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy">JukkaL / mypy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed">python / typeshed</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Talk about Python 3.x and type hints (from 3.5).</li>
      <li>I still use Python 2.7, but this talk made me want to use 3.x.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">google / protobuf</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc">grpc / grpc</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Talk about gRPC and Kubernetes by Googler.</li>
      <li>Good introduction to modern infrastructure, including concepts of containers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mocobeta/janome">mocobeta / janome</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Japanese morphological analyzer in Python.</li>
      <li>Easy to follow the talk about how Japanese morphological analyzer works.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/renyuanL/pythonTurtleInChinese">renyuanL / pythonTurtleInChinese</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Translate Python code into Chinese like <em>for i in 範囲(100):</em> (“範囲” means “range” in English)</li>
      <li>Thought-provoking talk on programming education.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/c-bata/pandas-validator">c-bata / pandas-validator</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/blaze/dask">blaze / dask</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fabric/fabric">fabric / fabric</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/click">mitsuhiko / click</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/airtoxin/pysqldf">airtoxin / pysqldf</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Lightning talks by 10 speakers.</li>
      <li>Some of them introduced very useful tools.</li>
      <li>Especially, since I became curious about command-line tool development with <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/click">Click</a>, I have tried it by creating <a href="https://github.com/takuti/hiss">tiny twitter client</a> after the talk.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there were many other interesting talks. In particular, presentations about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO5qvjAFMyg">tweet analysis</a>, <a href="http://intro2libsys.info/pycon-jp-2015">semantic web</a>, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sinhrks/pyconjp-2015-pandas-internals">pandas internals</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hagino_3000/ss-53786917">ad science</a> were good because these topics were very close to my current interests.</p>

<p>Since I am working on data science and machine learning research, one of the most impressive things is that several talks mentioned <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, Python data analysis library. I have realized how pandas (and IPython notebooks) are important tools for data scientists.</p>

<p>PyCon JP 2015 was really stimulating, and this was great opportunity to see <strong>possibilities of Python</strong>. I like to learn more about Python and use this language and related tools more effectively. And, importantly, I will use Python 3.x starting today :)</p>
