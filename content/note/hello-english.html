<p>Hi, I’m takuti.</p>

<p>Until now, this blog had only Japanese articles. However, from this post, <strong>blog.takuti.me</strong> switches to an English blog. Previous Japanese articles are available here continuously, but I will not write any more Japanese posts. If you want to read my Japanese, you can see it on <a href="http://takuti.hatenablog.com/">my hatenablog</a>, my Japanese blog on one of the most popular blog services in Japan.</p>

<p>Renewed <strong>blog.takuti.me</strong> may cover following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Several algorithms in Computer Science field (and their implenetations).</li>
  <li>Applications developed by me.</li>
  <li>Books and web sites which are technologically/scientifically stimulating.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, you can see my implementations and specific applications on <a href="https://github.com/takuti">my github repositories</a>. On this blog, I will explain about them more deeply.</p>

<p>Please send your comments freely! Everything is welcome. Thank you.</p>

<p>I said <em>“I will not write any more Japanese posts”</em> in this entry, but I will change the opinion. I use this blog as a bilingual blog; more specifically, I will write articles both in English and Japanese.</p>
