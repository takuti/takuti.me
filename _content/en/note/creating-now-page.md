This week, I have created a new page [takuti.me/**now**](/now). This will be a place where I share what I'm doing and focusing on, updated roughly once every 1-3 months. The idea is inspired by [Derek Sivers's /now page movement](https://sive.rs/nowff); the movement has spread rapidly, and [many people are actively sharing their immediate priorities](https://nownownow.com/).

> Think of **what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year**. [...] That’s what a now page is for.

I see this page is particularly useful not only for providing general updates about myself but more as a tool for maximizing my focus level and saying *NO* on a variety of occasions, as Derek Sivers also pointed out in the article.

I strongly believe deciding **what NOT to do** is equally or more important than choosing what to do. Without having solid criteria of rejection, there are infinite amounts of "opportunities" in our day-to-day life, and they simply confuse and disable us to make meaningful progress toward the ultimate goal we're originally trying to achieve. Notice that the point overlaps with [what I recently described in "Definition of Done"](/note/definition-of-done), and this is another underappreciated concept in project execution*&mdash;**"Out of Scope"**[^1].*

In fact, there are so many distractions that make what's truly important invisible:

- You may need to work on unimportant tasks at work, or you are invited to unnecessary meetings;
- Your friend may invite you to some fancy random gatherings on a weekend;
- There is so much fun content on the internet, including videos, music, social networks, and games.

I would check my **/now** page under these circumstances and question myself as *"Is this aligned with my current scope?"* I could also directly share the link with a friend, colleague, or stranger to ask their understanding.

I'm not saying we have to discard all of the above, and I do agree there are some serendipitous outcomes and positive effects of interacting with something/someone that seems to bring no immediate benefit. That said, we cannot take everything, and it's nearly impossible to say *YES* to all of them while making sure you always prioritize the most essential thing at the highest rank.

[Dr. Joseph Konstan](https://konstan.umn.edu/), the legendary professor in the field of recommender systems at University of Minnesota, previously stated *"Serendipity is a combination of what's relevant to you and what you didn't expect"* on a [podcast episode](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/recommender-systems-live-from-farcon), and *"if there is an irrelevant item you didn't expect, it's just bad"[^2].* Clarifying what matters most and what's relevant to me should come first, and serendipity follows.

Life is short. We can be more picky with the **/now** page so we don't overlook the truly important ones.
