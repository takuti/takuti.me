title: 'A Journey of Sustainable Development #SDGMOOC'

[Driving business towards the Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sdgbusiness) offered by Erasmus University Rotterdam was one of the best online courses I've ever taken. By showing real-world business cases, the well-structured course gave me a clear understanding of individual Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) following [the "wedding cake" model](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2016-06-14-how-food-connects-all-the-sdgs.html):

The point is **SDGs are mutually dependent**; our life (society) relies fully on the natural resources (biosphere), and economy exists on the top of human life. Therefore, each of us can contribute to SDGs both in personal and business. 

Key takeaways can be explained by the following quotes captured from the course videos.

> Sustainability is a journey and not a destination.<br/><br/>&mdash;Bob Collymore, A former CEO of [Safaricom](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/)

Most importantly, the issues in ecological, social, and economical sustainability are made up of many different factors, and there is no clear "goal" that we can stop maintaining the sustainability. When you eat, buy, move, work&mdash;Throughout our entire life, we have to keep thinking the problems and taking as many actions as possible. That's the only way to achieve SDGs in the true sense.

What I really like about the course is they emphasized an importance of system thinking, which requires us to holistically consider mutually dependent problems while comparing synergies vs. trade-offs. If you start using a shopping bag to reduce consumption of plastic bags, that's great. However, where is your shopping bag created? Typically, such mass products are created in lower income counties, and economical/social sustainability remains even though your effort mitigates a ecological problem.

> Too many companies are hiding behind charity while they say we take our responsibility. Charity is not taking responsibility, taking responsibility is changing the core of your operations.<br/><br/>&mdash;Arjen Boekhold, Co-founder of [Tony's Chocolonely](https://tonyschocolonely.com/us/en/our-mission)

Additionally, the actions must be taken responsibly. It is important to be serious about the issues as a personal matter, and short-term (or even one-time), indirect contribution won't be sufficient. It's better than nothing though. Hence, having a solid plan is important to seriously tackle the problems, and [Your Plan, Your Planet by Google](https://yourplanyourplanet.sustainability.google/) and [The Lazy Personâ€™s Guide to Saving the World](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/takeaction/) can be a good place to begin with.

Speaking of SDGs in business, sustainability is a big business opportunity for companies as I described in **[Environmental Problems Through the Lens of Business](/note/environmental-problems-and-business/)**. In fact, the goals cannot be achieved without a deep, long-term integration with business, and what solving global problems needs includes but are not limited to funding/financial strategy, project management, and business development.

Unfortunately, there is a contradiction that truly meaningful business from the sustainable perspective is less profitable. To overcome the problem, a drastic change of the system is needed; if there is a high tax rate for human activities that cause air pollution, if product prices reflect social impact to prices, if plastic is more expensive, ...these are the points discussed in **[My First Impression After Reading Bill Gates's "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster"](/note/how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster/)**.

### Hamming bird challenges

- SDG tracker https://sdg-tracker.org/

1. Calculate env footprint - https://www.footprintcalculator.org/result1
2. Try to reduce the use of plastic, and recycle them / Reuse coffee cups, take a bag to groccery store
3. Take a look at clothes tag, check origin, see if brand is included to transparency list: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/
4. subconscious associations for people who are different from you, for example in their gender, religion, race or political views. These associations may steer your behavior without you being aware of it. The test that assesses them is called the Implicit Association Test (IAT).  https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
5. Trace the origin of my lunch; how the ingredients respect people & environment; transparency
6. Possibility of collaboration. My company - How do they contribute to SGDs? Are there any "unusual" collaboration partners that could help the organization make an impact on SDGs while maintaining both sides's benefits & strengths?
7. System mapping - "Cup of coffee" -> what's needed? what's considered? https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-systems-mapping-2db5cf30ab3a



### My action items

1. Reduce daily energy use and save electricity & water.
2. Review my job through the lens of SDGs and choose a career that I can believe it's meaningful; avoid [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs).
3. Make meat-free day(s), and regularly eat more vegetable and less meat.
