### Note

- how my idea can be easily biased by existing apps (e.g., fitbit, runkeeper)
- power of language as a design tool

### Project Title

Accutive

(Accumulate active -> competitive * productive)

- Entertaining — game, competitive, achievement, 
- Simple — Easy, succinct, minimamilistic 
- Efficient — Fast, quick, look-at-glance 
- Scientific — MET, paper, research, numbers
- Practical — Advice, coach, improve, fitness, healthy, productive

### Write a short description of your project idea. The description should answer the following questions: What is it, Who is it for, and Where does it live?

A heartbeat monitor for software engineers working from home under the COVID-19 crisis, which tracks, quantifies, and visualizes your activity level on a phone, to get motivated to stay active and healthy for a long time.

### Write a tagline for your project, using suitable language aligned with the intended audience.

Accumulate active minutes while working remotely, and be more productive than the others.

### Describe the main activity or function of the app. What will the user be able to do from the app's home screen?

By collecting the heartbeat records from a smartphone, Accutive automatically calculates a daily activity level and visualizes it with simple icons on a minimalistic view of the app. Software engineers, who tend to spend too much unhealthy and inactive time on a chair, can intuitively understand their activeness in comparison with the other users. The app navigates the users to detailed analysis of time-series heartbeat data and various reading materials, such as an effective walking posture and how physical activity improves our productivity, based on scientific evidence.

### Upload a mood board containing your visual research for your project idea.

Accutive bridges your productive but unhealthy working hours on a chair to an active and healthier way of spending your free time.


### Step-by-step description of interactions

At the end of a run, the user opens their heartbeat app on their phone. A visual cue on the screen instructs the user to place their thumb lightly over your phone’s home button. When their thumb is in the proper position, the app will cue a 15-second countdown timer on the screen. At the end of the 15 seconds, the timer will disappear and replaced with the heart rate.

Before going to bed, the user opens the app on their phone

### Week 1

#### Project Title

mywalk

#### Write your app’s name and tagline.

- Used https://namelix.com/

mywalk

Walk around your neighborhood with recommendations from mywalk.

#### Write a short paragraph describing your app. Make sure to mention what the app does and what problem it solves.

- note taking memo
- todo list, to 'be' list, share todolist
- voice memo, diary
- footprint, step, walking, places to visit
- hiking course recommender
- persona, behavior, personalization
- beer bar, map, ..

- -> too much considered about technical feasibility, profitability, name conflict, ...

mywalk solves a problem that finding a good local place to visit on holidays and weekends is not easy. To solve the problem, the app recommends the best places to go now around user's neighborhood and helps active people to enjoy their time.

#### Describe four specific functions that your app will do. List these ideas in order of importance, with the first idea being the most important.

1. Recommend the best nearby places to go now.
2. Ask a user some questions about their current feeling, emotion, and atmosphere, as well as basic demographics, for personalization.
3. Consider external factors such as weather and time of day to make more accurate recommendations.
4. Navigate users to a recommended place on a map.

#### List 4 potential roles that are a part of your initial user target group. Then, expand on one of the roles with a detailed profile description of one of these potential users.

1. Runner
2. Traveler
3. Photographer
4. Foodie

Traveler -- Ken is a Tokyo-based 25-year old software engineer who travels a lot for both work and pleasure. He is single and living in a cozy apartment room. In his spare time, he enjoys walking outside for exploring local places, especially when he's traveling and visiting a new area. He likes drinking beer & coffee and be interested in modern arts, and hiking is his another hobby. Therefore, while walking, he usually searches a good beer bar, coffee shop, museum, and/or outdoor sports store nearby on Google.

#### Come up with 4 client/designer goals for your app design. You don't have to assign these to a category (political, social, etc). List your goals in order of importance, with the first goal being the most important.

1. Shorten time to search for a good local destination
2. Make the app useful at any time and anywhere
3. Motivate the users to walk outside with fun
4. Build a community to deliver more reliable information

#### Name and briefly describe 3 existing apps that are similar to your app idea.

- Google Map: A map app that enables us to search for any kind of place and navigates there.
- Foursquare: A location-based social networking service for collecting a wide variety of places (e.g., restaurants, shops, parks) and their community reviews.
- TripAdvisor: A travel assistant app collecting popular destinations, ranging from hotels to activities, with user-generated content such as reviews and comments.
