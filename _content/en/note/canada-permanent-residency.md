It's been more than a year since [I relocated to Canada in Feb 2021](/note/relocating-to-canada/), and I have officially become a permanent resident of Canada this week. My major motivation of being a permanent resident is to maximize the flexibility of choosing a job and [possibly getting education](/note/goes-back-to-school/) in this country.

Thanks to [BC Provincial Nominee Program - Tech](https://www.welcomebc.ca/Immigrate-to-B-C/Skills-Immigration) (BC PNP Tech), the application process was very smooth even though I [changed an employer](/note/td-to-amazon/) in the middle; I was fortunately able to work with highly supportive attorneys both in the previous and current company, and my PR application has been approved much quicker than I expected[^1]. Here is a rough timeline I have undergone:

- (2021/02) Moved to Canada from Japan with a work permit. Took IELTS, an English test required for PR application, 2 days before the flight.
- (2021/06) Applied for BC PNP Tech.
- (2021/07) Accepted BC PNP nomination, and received an invitation to apply for permanent residence.
- (2021/08) Changed an employer. Initiated BC PNP post-nomination process.
- (2021/12) Re-received BC PNP nomination and invitation to apply for permanent residence.
- (2022/02) Applied for permanent residence.
- (2022/06) Received an approval of my PR application, and the status has been confirmed in less than a week.

Note that the processing time varies depending on various factors. Everyone must refer to the government's website for the latest information. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacted the process both in positive and negative ways, but I believe none of them was a significant blocker/accelerator. On a positive side, for example, the university I graduated from temporarily accepted a request for issuing a certificate of degree by email, which usually can be requested only by mail with a paper-based application. On the other hand, there was a little bit of confusion when I was trying to obtain a police certificate; the police office's fingerprinting service and embassy's operations were irregular during the pandemic.

In the coming months, I'm simply excited to explore a wide range of possibilities I additionally gained as a result of the PR status. I still don't know what this news actually means for my life, but what happens happens.

> I'm optimistic about my life in the long run, whereas I'm pessimistic enough about uncontrollable events that could occur in the near future.<br/><br/>[Next "Dot" in Journey: Curiosity-Driven Job Change in Canada (Aug 2021)](/note/td-to-amazon/)

Life is unpredictable, and hence I would like to keep adding randomness to my life. Wherever my curiosity is satisfied under uncertainty, I will be there.

Will I literally reside in the country permanently? Am I planning to apply for Canadian citizenship? I don't know to be honest, but no matter what the next steps look like, I look forward to establishing a deeper connection to the lovely Metro Vancouver area as a first step.

[^1]: It's actually too fast. I'm planning to fly to Japan in less than 3 weeks for a family matter, but it is recommended not to go outside of Canada until I get a PR card. Otherwise, a special procedure would be required to re-enter Canada. Thus, I'm currently in a difficult situation to make the urgent trip happen...
