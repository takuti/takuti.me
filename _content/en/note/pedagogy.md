There are many educational practices out there.

Recognizing the complexity, communities proposed a methodology called [Design-Based Research](https://edtechbooks.org/education_research/design_based_research) (DBR). In contrast to traditional studies conducted in controlled laboratory settings, DBR puts academic studies into context by placing researchers as collaborative agents with subjects. Through the field collaboration and iterative design and feedback process, DBR aims to yield authentic and useful knowledge in classroom practices.

As such, researchers are working hard to streamline best practices, make tactics actionable, and keep things up-to-date. And, especially in the Global North, teachers are very much aware of what is desired in theory.

To the best of my knowledge, the following components signify modern pedagogy.

- **Digital skills**, as society actively bridges the first- and second-level of the digital divide through infrastructure development and skill training projects. It is necessary to respond to the technological advancement in classrooms.
- **Cultural understanding** to overcome realistic constraints, acknowledge local contexts, and develop long-lasting, tool-agnostic skills in the information age. In fact, [digital skills may be optional](/note/offline-learning) to achieve an educational goal.
- **Agency** for what Brazilian educator Paulo Freire called critical consciousness and problem-posing education, which liberate and humanize learners through participation. It is also the key to [bridge the third-level of the digital divide](/note/digital-divide).

The [incompleteness of computer education in low-income countries](/note/computer-education-in-malawi) can be explained by the lack of cultural understanding and learners' agency, for example.

In the meantime, during the COVID-19 pandemic, digitally unprepared people were unable to continue their learning journey as the rest of the world went online, though it unlocked another avenue for [low-tech innovations](https://ab.takuti.me/p/low-tech-approach-for-mass-remote-education).

So, education will be good for all, as long as we digitize tools (e.g., tablets, LMS), make topics relevant to students' daily lives, respect them, and incorporate participatory and interactive exercises into classrooms (e.g., games, group discussion).

Most futuristic narratives stop here. But, really?

I recently had a chance to participate in such a "pedagogically correct" classroom for my French learning, and honestly, I wouldn't like it.

### My Language Class

Well, my classmates and our teacher are great. They are very nice and kind people, and the level of the class seems well-aligned with my level. Yet, there are three foundational challenges apart from it.

First, digital tools make courses highly predictable.

Our teacher actively uses technology. For example, we have a Moodle-based online portal for content management, and there are tons of graphics and quizzes to help learning. Classes can also be done online via Microsoft Teams whenever necessary. Moreover, the teacher works effectively with ChatGPT to generate exercises and key vocabulary lists from lengthy transcripts.

However, if technology helps that much, I&mdash;someone who can independently work the tools&mdash;think, "What's the point of travelling more than an hour daily to come to this 'digitized classroom'?"

Second, there is always a chance of contextual mismatch.

The content of our French class focuses primarily on newcomers in Canada, and we learn a lot of vocabulary and expressions in realistic scenarios (e.g., Canadian community service and citizenship). It is a good example of cultural adaptation of learning experiences. This also serves well for the purpose of the [government-funded program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/settle-canada/language-skills/classes.html).

That said, learners are not equally "new" to the country, and each of us has our own needs and seeds, as well as varying understanding of the context we're currently in. I personally found the situational aspect of the course boring and demotivating.

Third, active learning practices force learners to participate in the class.

Our class often gives us opportunities to learn from games and interactive feedback. I sometimes feel uncomfortable with them because it seems participation is "mandatory" in the environment, as if being told, "If you don't participate, that's bad." Some will enjoy it, while others won't.

Not to mention, when there is a greater degree of agency among participants, the room can easily become competitive; those who are willing to participate will receive better recognition from teachers and parents, and we unconsciously play this attention-seeking game while losing the original joy and motivation for the subject itself. (That's why I hate anything competitive.)

In the end, learning shouldn't be for short-term efficiency, usefulness, pleasure, or achievements. Rather, it needs to be a sustainable journey that continues for years or a lifetime. It doesn't make sense if I become conversational in French in the next few months but forget everything after I complete the class.

Overall, the French class has undoubtedly been one of the most well-developed in-class experiences I've ever had. However, by putting everyone into the same room and letting them follow a prescribed format, the one-to-many education setup has posed its structural limitations.

So, pedagogical correctness doesn't guarantee whether an educational program works for a certain person or not.

### If you know what you want to teach (learn)

There is no silver bullet, and even if everyone followed best practices with good intentions at a micro level, gaps and inequalities will emerge as soon as multiple agents (people) start interacting with each other and forming a system. No two people are the same!

Thus, it'd be essential to provide multiple options when it comes to learning. Personalization, that is. I didn't find best practices derived from modern pedagogy helpful in my French classroom, but the same format can work perfectly for other subjects. Or I may simply enjoy receiving one-way lectures and reflecting deeply alone at home. Meanwhile, you may need a 1:1 tutor, not a group teacher.

It's not to say which teaching method is "better" or "worse." Rather, since everything can potentially work, we need to first understand learners' context at the right granularity. And a tailored learning path needs to be co-developed.
