### SDGs

- Hamming bird challenge
  1. Calculate env footprint - https://www.footprintcalculator.org/result1
  2. Try to reduce the use of plastic, and recycle them / Reuse coffee cups, take a bag to groccery store
  3. Take a look at clothes tag, check origin, see if brand is included to transparency list: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/
  4. subconscious associations for people who are different from you, for example in their gender, religion, race or political views. These associations may steer your behavior without you being aware of it. The test that assesses them is called the Implicit Association Test (IAT).  https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
  5. Trace the origin of my lunch; how the ingredients respect people & environment; transparency
  6. Possibility of collaboration. My company - How do they contribute to SGDs? Are there any "unusual" collaboration partners that could help the organization make an impact on SDGs while maintaining both sides's benefits & strengths?
  7. System mapping - "Cup of coffee" -> what's needed? what's considered? https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-systems-mapping-2db5cf30ab3a
- Supply chain is disrupted by climate change (severe disaster)
- Tax for the pollution; reflect social impact to prices; plastic should be more expensive
  - Externalities
  - Hard to define the number/price. Do need a collaboration across the globe
- "Sustainable production" partnering with knowledgeable collaborators
- SDG tracker https://sdg-tracker.org/
- Unfortunately, real meaningful business from the sustainable perspective is less profitable. Business + ecological problem is a key area; "how business school contribute to ecosystem restoration - funding/financial strategy, project management, business development
- How sustainability is a big business opportunity for companies
- **Charity is not taking responsibility.**
  - Take responsibility, and don't be satisfied with short-term mitigation
  - How? Your plan by Google - https://yourplanyourplanet.sustainability.google/
- Support local
- Value to be determined by stakeholder's value rather than production quantity
- Make cities/communities smarter and more sustainable by integrating IT
- Social enterprise needs a business model; need to grow to sustain; radical transparency - extreme ownership
- "Build or join something to change"
- Safety workplace = leadership & manager / behavioral aspect matters 
- How to motivate? - Leaders need to not only tell urgency & how serious the problem is, but convey the future & vision that motivates the innovation
- In business, predictability is important for shareholders. Sustainability and circular economy matches the need nicely as it is based on long-term vision of the company's growth and innovation.
- What "I" can do: https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/takeaction/

- System thinking - synergies vs. trade-offs among the goals
- Sustainability is a journey, not like a destination

1. Did you achieve your goals?
  - y
2. Were there any obstacles and difficulties in achieving them? How did you overcome them?
  - Considering the problems that are invisible in my daily life is difficult.
3. Were there any unexpected insights or learning outcomes?
  - Connection (dependency) between business and sustainable activities; I thought the latter is more like a charity, but it's not.
4. What is the most inspiring insight that you've obtained through this MOOC?
  - So many businesses are now using SGDs as an accelerator toward their & our long-term success.
- Action items
  1. Less energy use
  2. My career to be aligned with SGDs; no more bullshit job
  3. Meat-less day
