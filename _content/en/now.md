### Deepening my professional activities and personal relationships

In September 2022, I [started a new career as an independent software developer](/note/becoming-a-freelancer-in-canada), focusing particularly on data & machine learning productization. After three months of enjoying the flexible lifestyle, I noticed that what I'm working on and how I interact with others are becoming "shallow". I reviewed the sensation in [my 2022 annual review](/note/annual-review-2022/), and right now, I'm trying to seek an opportunity that requires me to make a deeper, longer-term commitment so that I can prioritize quality over quantity, both professionally and personally. Although the challenge might be just a common thing among contracting jobs and should be considered as a cost for a better quality of life, it is important for me to keep questioning my situation in order to optimize it further.

### Tightening my connection to Canada

As a resident of British Columbia in Canada, I would like to contribute to the local communities however I can. The reason is not only that I'm simply loving the beautiful place but am concerned about many ongoing issues in society, the economy, and the environment. A list of action items includes but is not limited to buying & eating local products, meeting with local people, learning about the past, present, and future of the place, and spending my time and skills on opportunities associated with a location that is geographically closer to me.

### Accumulating more experience and knowledge in nature

As a hiker and resident of the earth, I intentionally spend my spare time in nature as much as possible. For hiking, I'm an active follower of ***[105 Hikes In and Around Southwestern British Columbia](https://105hikes.com/book/)***, and I have done 24 hikes out of 105 as of writing. Meanwhile, my current objective is not only to explore as many local trails as possible but to deepen my knowledge & skill further. To be more precise, while continuously gaining practical tools like [Canadian Red Cross's Remote First Aid & CPR certificate](https://www.redcross.ca/training-and-certification/course-descriptions/first-aid-at-home-courses/wilderness-remote-first-aid-program), I'm recently learning more about environmental science to seek a way of making positive contributions to this beautiful planet.

### Living well: Practicing how to eat, workout, and rest more effectively

I am a runner, and my most recent accomplishment was a full marathon finished with a [personal best of 3'57 at the Royal Victoria Marathon](https://startlinetiming.com/en/races/2022/victoriamarathon/view/1007) in October 2022. The next milestone is to run a sub-3.5 marathon. An upcoming race [Ottawa Half Marathon](https://www.runottawa.ca/races-and-events/half-marathon) in May 2023 would be a part of preparation towards the goal. For me, running is a way to maintain and strengthen my mental health because the habit naturally requires me to eat well, rest enough, and push my limitation. Not to mention that physical endurance is equally or more important, and I'm trying to gain proper knowledge and practice for muscle growth, recovery, and injury prevention.
