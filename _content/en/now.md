<i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> From my apartment room in Ottawa, Canada, where I experience a "real" Canadian holiday season for the first time, with more snow, coldness, and home parties.

### As a digital enablement expert

After almost two years of beautiful time in [Malawi](/malawi), I returned to Canada with a great passion to keep building my life and career in the impact sector. Currently, I strategically position [my independent business](/services) to promote digital participation and inclusion through consultancy, advisory services, and mentorship, particularly in low-resource contexts. I also regularly [write](/ab) about digital inequality and the way to bridge the divide.

### Learning French

After moving to Ottawa, where more than 35% of the population is [bilingual](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/as-sa/fogs-spg/page.cfm?lang=E&topic=6&dguid=2021A00053506008), I suddenly feel obligated to practice French; from business to daily life, available opportunities seem to be noticeably limited if you only speak English. Hence, I'm actively studying the basics through apps and books, and I recently completed my first language assessment (which was NCLC Level 2) to join a [government-funded language class](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/settle-canada/language-skills/classes.html). My goal is to reach the intermediate level by the end of 2026.

### Be lean in my life

Even though I live relatively minimally as a working-from-home freelancer, the inhumane speed of life in the Western world is still overwhelming and distracting compared to what it was in Africa. I don't really feel grounded thanks to the hyper-connected economy built on intangible societal expectations and profit-maximizing best practices. To escape from the abundance, I'm thinking more about what *not* to do rather than what to do nowadays, so I can organize my life while maintaining a sharp focus on what matters most. This means: routinely running on a treadmill at the gym, eating out less, simplifying my investment and credit card portfolio, time-blocking my calendar, and prioritizing a handful of important people through consistent and intentional engagement. It is a practice to say NO to more.
