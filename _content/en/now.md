### Weekly newsletter about "tech for good"

My current focus is to equip changemakers with actionable insights for making sustainable, long-lasting impact in the digital age. While [promoting equitable access to ICT from one of the poorest countries in the world](/malawi), I learned that the development work in the field significantly lacks context awareness, informed decision, and overall productivity. This gap often leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities to create meaningful change. How can we tackle this systemic challenge and ensure that technology development truly serves those in need?

To begin with, I'm collecting various case studies and data in technology development across the globe in a weekly newsletter "**[Altruistic Byte](https://ab.takuti.me/subscribe)**," to broaden and deepen our understanding of digital transformation.

Meanwhile, I continuously work with Malawian individuals and businesses to learn from firsthand experience. For instance, I currently serve as the Acting ICT Director at a [Malawian non-profit](https://emergelivelihoods.org/) as part of broader technology consultation work.

### Beyond Malawi

As a Canadian self-employed business owner, I have clients not only in North America but also in Asia and Africa. I'm genuinely proud of the diverse portfolio and exposure to different culture. However, in reality, my time and energy for the last two years has been skewed significantly towards a single country: Malawi. Despite a little-to-no change in my business portfolio and the country's political and economic landscape, I even reached a point where life in Malawi feels strangely easy. Not to mention it's largely because I, as a privileged expat, already have sufficient funds, a decent job, and quality local connections. Hence, I can vividly visualize how my life would look like a year later if I were to keep investing myself in the country.

To me, this "getting stuck" feeling is a clear red flag. By contrast, uncertainty and unforeseen stimulus have driven my career for more than a decade. I believe such challenge-seeking behavior is crucial for changemakers so that we can constantly break the status quo while facing the multifaceted nature of our world.

So, it is time to move on. As of writing, I'm in the middle of month-long stay in Cape Town, South Africa for further opportunity exploration in sub-Saharan Africa.

### Scale my business

Working independently on social issues may not be sustainable in the long term due to resource constraints and scalability challenges. Thus, I am exploring alternative ways to scale my efforts. For example, I provide [1:1 online mentorship](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/takuyakitazawa) to mentees across the globe, but what if I package the offering as structured educational content? Or, although I've been writing a personal blog for years to share tangible observations and insights [here](/note), I could elevate them as more structured publications for targeted audiences - like the newsletter above. I'm actively seeking such opportunities and eager to collaborate with other businesses and global citizens. [Contact me](/contact) if you are interested.
