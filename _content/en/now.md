title: What I'm Doing Now

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). I will update the page roughly on a monthly basis to share where I am, what I'm focusing on, and [what I don't do](/note/creating-now-page/).*

**Last updated**: February 13, 2022 @ North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

### Practicing [ethical product development](/note/ethical-product-developer/)

Being conscious about the externalities of what I’m creating as a product developer is the biggest personal challenge at this moment.

After several years of industry experience as an engineer, scientist, as well as product manager, I started questioning myself as *"Should I build this?"* on a regular basis. That's why I decided to give a shot at an [engineering role in a big company](/note/td-to-amazon/), which contradicts to my strong preference for start-up; I'm learning from how they build a product and establish their corporate culture in terms of technology, design, and business decisions from both ethical and sustainability standpoint.

### Revisiting my recommender system libraries

I’m actively developing two of my personal projects, [FluRS](https://github.com/takuti/flurs/) (Python) and [Recommendation.jl](https://github.com/takuti/Recommendation.jl/) (Julia), which I originally created as part of my master’s thesis back in 2017. By the end of 2022, I’m aiming to fully polish the tools and publish their version 1.0 with some external presentations.

In practice, the design aspect of recommender systems (e.g., code structure, system architecture, UI/UX decisions, evaluation metrics) are crucial to make a system truly meaningful both for developers and end users, and hence I use these projects as a hands-on training opportunity to be an ethical product developer.

### Living in Canada

It's been almost a year since [I relocated from Japan to Canada “just as an experience”](/note/relocating-to-canada/). Overall, I'm loving the beautiful walkable city, where I can easily expose myself to nature while maintaining the major benefits of an urban life.

To be fair, I still believe Japan is the best place to live, but who knows? I’m trying to enjoy the place as much as possible and be part of lovely local communities as long as I’m here.

### Hiking as "deeply" as possible

On the weekends, I'm busy hiking.

I'm an active follower of "[105 Hikes In and Around Southwestern British Columbia](https://105hikes.com/book/)", and I have done 16 hikes out of 105 as of writing. My current objective is not only exploring as much local trails as possible but deepening my knowledge & skill further; as a first step, I have a plan to take a [remote first aid training](https://www.redcross.ca/training-and-certification/course-descriptions/first-aid-at-home-courses/wilderness-remote-first-aid-program).

### Running long distance

I have registered and am actively practicing for [Vancouver Marathon](https://bmovanmarathon.ca/) in May, 2022, which is going to be my first post-pandemic full marathon race.

While I had mainly focused on indoor strength training since the beginning of the pandemic, the extremely walkable area of Metro Vancouver re-motivated me to spend more time on outdoor running, both on trail and road. I ran [my very first trail running race](https://www.alltrails.com/es/explore/recording/hallow-s-eve-2021-36a16a2) last year, and, to improve my mobility and flexibility further, I have recently enriched my daily workout routine with core training & yoga courses on Apple Fitness+.

### Being enthusiastic about BC Ale Trail

Exploring local craft breweries has clearly become a dominant part of my life lately.

There are hundreds of breweries across the province as you can find on [BC Ale Trail](/note/2021-bcat-best-brewery-experience-award/), and I immediately fell in love with how people demonstrate their creativity to make diverse tastes of beers with a strong connection to their local community. To enjoy every single sip even further, I’m currently studying for the [Beer Judge Certification Program entrance exam](https://www.bjcp.org/exam-certification/exam-program-overview/).
