### Crystallizing my experiences in information technology

With empathy as a core value, my current mission is to strengthen our lives in the information-rich world so that everyone lives life to the fullest without being manipulated, exploited, or marginalized by the power dynamics in today's capitalist world. Since I repeatedly saw friends, relatives, mentees, colleagues, or even myself who suffered from psychological or financial issues due to an unbalanced information diet and distorted view of the world, I'm searching for an exit from the negative loop by questioning [how information flows in our society](/note/how-information-flows/). In particular, I am spending more time learning from philosophical, religious, and social scientific studies to cultivate my awareness of micro-level communication and its role in larger systems.

### Deepening my relationships with surrounding people and environment

As a Canadian Permanent Resident, I would like to contribute to the local communities however I can. The reason is not only that I'm simply loving the beautiful place but am concerned about many ongoing issues in society, the economy, and the environment. For example, I eat local products, mostly plants from farmers' markets, while learning about the past, present, and future of the land by visiting museums and taking online courses. Ultimately, I intentionally spend my time and skills on opportunities associated with a person/location/experience that is closer to me, e.g., for volunteering, in terms of travel destinations, by prioritizing lived experiences through face-to-face communications.

### Living well: Practicing how to eat, workout, and rest more effectively

I am a runner, and my most recent accomplishments were [Vancouver Half Marathon](https://www.sportstats.one/display-results.xhtml?raceid=118168&status=results&bib=20432) (1'35) and [Ottawa Half Marathon](https://www.sportstats.ca/display-results.xhtml?raceid=118517&status=results&bib=8832) (1'31) in May 2023. The next big milestone is to run a sub-3.5 marathon, following [sub-4 finish at the Royal Victoria Marathon in Oct 2022](https://startlinetiming.com/en/races/2022/victoriamarathon/view/1007). For me, running is a way to maintain and strengthen my mental health because the habit naturally requires me to eat well, rest enough, and push my limitation. Not to mention that physical endurance is equally or more important, and I'm trying to gain proper knowledge and practice for muscle growth, recovery, and injury prevention.

### Accumulating more experience and knowledge in nature

As a hiker and resident of the earth, I intentionally spend my spare time in nature as much as possible. For hiking, I'm an active follower of *[105 Hikes In and Around Southwestern British Columbia](https://105hikes.com/book/),* and I have done 26 hikes out of 105 as of writing. Meanwhile, my current objective is not only to explore as many local trails as possible but to deepen my knowledge & skill further. To be more precise, while continuously gaining practical tools like [Canadian Red Cross's Remote First Aid & CPR certificate](https://www.redcross.ca/training-and-certification/course-descriptions/first-aid-at-home-courses/wilderness-remote-first-aid-program), I'm recently learning more about environmental science to seek a way of making positive contributions to this beautiful planet.
