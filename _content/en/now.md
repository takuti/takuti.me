### Growing as a freelancer

In September 2022, I [started a new career as an independent software developer](/note/becoming-a-freelancer-in-canada) and [spent a fruitful first month](/note/first-month-as-self-employed/), focusing particularly on data & AI ethics and machine learning productization. There are three pillars of my work: *empathy,* *ethics,* and *externality.* While I want to be honest with my personal feeling (empathy), I also want to be mindful of the long-term, eventual consequence of my work (externality). Ultimately, I need to ensure the deliverables are ethically crafted throughout an end-to-end development lifecycle. It all means that I am picky about an opportunity, but a general principle is the more aligned with the other objectives I state below, the higher chance of moving forward with the opportunity.

### Tightening my connection to Canada

As a resident of British Columbia in Canada, I would like to contribute to the local communities however I can. The reason is not only that I'm simply loving the beautiful place but am concerned about many ongoing issues in society, the economy, and the environment. A list of action items includes but is not limited to buying & eating local products, meeting with local people, learning about the past, present, and future of the place, and spending my time and skills on opportunities associated with a location that is geographically closer to me.

### Accumulating more experience and knowledge in nature

As a hiker and resident of the earth, I intentionally spend my spare time in nature as much as possible. For hiking, I'm an active follower of "[105 Hikes In and Around Southwestern British Columbia](https://105hikes.com/book/)", and I have done 21 hikes out of 105 as of writing. Meanwhile, my current objective is not only to explore as many local trails as possible but to deepen my knowledge & skill further. To be more precise, while continuously gaining practical tools like [Canadian Red Cross's Remote First Aid & CPR certificate](https://www.redcross.ca/training-and-certification/course-descriptions/first-aid-at-home-courses/wilderness-remote-first-aid-program), I'm recently learning more about environmental science to seek a way of making positive contributions to this beautiful planet.

### Living well: Eating, running, and resting

I am a runner, and my most recent accomplishment was a full marathon finished with the [personal record of 3h57m at the Royal Victoria Marathon](https://startlinetiming.com/en/races/2022/victoriamarathon/view/1007) in October 2022. An upcoming race would be an easy 12k trail run at [The Phantom Run](https://foretrails.com/the-phantom-run/) in North Vancouver, BC, Canada in November. For me, running is a way to maintain and strengthen my mental health because the habit naturally requires me to eat well, rest enough, and push my limitation. Not to mention that physical endurance is equally or more important, and I'm trying to gain proper knowledge and practice for muscle growth, recovery, and injury prevention.

### Advocating BC craft beer culture

Exploring local craft breweries has been a dominant part of my life since I relocated to Canada. There are hundreds of breweries across the province as you can find on [BC Ale Trail](/note/2021-bcat-best-brewery-experience-award/), and I immediately fell in love with how people demonstrate their creativity to make diverse tastes of beers with a strong connection to their local community. To enjoy every single sip even further, Iâ€™m currently studying for the [Beer Judge Certification Program entrance exam](https://www.bjcp.org/exam-certification/exam-program-overview/).
