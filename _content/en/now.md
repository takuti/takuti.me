<i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> From my new apartment room in Ottawa, ON, Canada, where I can see the beautiful autumn leaves falling and sense the beginning of winter.

### Back from Malawi

After almost two years of beautiful time in [Malawi](/malawi), I returned to Canada with a great passion to keep building my life and career in the impact sector. To continuously expose myself to the complex issues our world embodies, I also moved to Ottawa, ON, the capital city of Canada, where many government agencies and non-profits are based. By immersing myself in the world's most urgent problems, I'd like to challenge today's societal, economic, and educational systems. I won't relocate again until I renew my Canadian permanent residency by at least 2027.

### More reading and writing

It's been a lazy summer this year: spending three months in Japan catching up with families and friends, travelling across the country (though it was too hot), and enjoying a pile of my brother's old manga in our parents' house. Being fully recharged, it's time to activate my brain. To begin with, I will restart [writing](/note) regularly, while rethinking the use of my [tech-for-good newsletter](https://ab.takuti.me/subscribe).

Meanwhile, I'm recently reading about social design/entrepreneurship methodologies for my next project. I'm also thinking of investing my time in professional certificates in ICT (e.g., [ITIL](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/itil), [CSPO](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/product-owner-track/certified-scrum-product-owner)); even though I tend to avoid them for the theory-practice gap, the structured knowledge seems to be an essential asset to work with(in) governments and international organizations worldwide.

### Learning French

More than 35% of the population in Ottawa is [bilingual](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/as-sa/fogs-spg/page.cfm?lang=E&topic=6&dguid=2021A00053506008), for its proximity to the French-speaking province of Quebec, as well as the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-languages-bilingualism.html) itself. So, I would feel it's unjust if I didn't spend effort on acknowledging bilingualism and practicing French. Little by little, I'm learning the basics and vocabulary through apps and books.
