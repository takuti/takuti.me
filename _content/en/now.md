### Weekly newsletter about "tech for good"

In July 2024, I completed [my one-year assignment as a Canadian international volunteer in Malawi](/malawi), a small landlocked country in southeastern Africa, aiming to promote equitable access to ICT from one of the poorest countries in the world. In response to my observations, I recently launched a weekly newsletter "**[Altruistic Byte](https://ab.takuti.me/subscribe)**," enabling changemakers to make informed decisions for sustainable, long-lasting impact in the digital age.

### Beyond Malawi

As a Canadian self-employed business owner, I have clients not only in North America but also in Asia and Africa. And I love traveling for my personal life. Here is where I have flown to in 2024 as a consequence:

However, in reality, my time and energy for the last 20 months or so has significantly been skewed towards a single country: Malawi. Despite a little-to-no change in my business portfolio and the country's political and economic landscape, I even reached a point where life in Malawi feels strangely simple, easy, and comfortable. Not to mention it's largely because I, as a privileged expat, already have sufficient funds, a decent job, and quality local connections. Hence, I can vividly visualize how my life would look like a year later if I were to keep investing myself in the country.

To me, this comfort is a clear red flag. By contrast, uncertainty and unforeseen stimulus have driven my career for more than a decade. I believe such challenge-seeking behavior is crucial for changemakers so that we can constantly break the status quo while facing the multifaceted nature of our world.

So, it is time to move on. My current focus is to digest what I have gained in Malawi and go beyond that. Although the details are yet to be confirmed, [email me](mailto:hello@takuti.me) if you are interested in philanthropic initiatives in tech, especially in/from sub-Saharan Africa, Japan, or Canada.

### Scale my business

Working on social issues independently won't be a sustainable move in the long run. For example, I provide [1:1 online mentorship](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/takuyakitazawa) to mentees across the globe, but what if I package the offering as structured educational content? Or, although I've been writing a personal blog for years to share tangible observations and insights [here](/note), I could elevate them as more structured publications for targeted audiences - like the newsletter above. I'm actively seeking such opportunities and eager to collaborate with other businesses. [Contact me](/contact) if you are interested.
