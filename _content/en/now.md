### Weekly newsletter about "tech for good"

In July 2024, I completed [my one-year assignment as a Canadian international volunteer in Malawi](/malawi), a small landlocked country in southeastern Africa, aiming to promote equitable access to ICT from one of the poorest countries in the world. In response to my observations, I recently launched a weekly newsletter "**[Altruistic Byte](https://ab.takuti.me/subscribe)**," enabling changemakers to make informed decisions for sustainable, long-lasting impact in the digital age.

### Traveling

As a Canadian self-employed business owner, I have clients not only in North America but also in Asia and Africa. And I love traveling for my personal life. Here is where I have flown to in 2024 as a consequence:

While I still spend a good chunk of my time in 2025 in Malawi for volunteering, client engagement, and opportunity exploration, I currently have a plan to visit London (UK), Vancouver (Canada), El Paso (USA), Kampala (Uganda), Nairobi and Mombasa (Kenya) in March-April. [Email me](mailto:hello@takuti.me) if you are around!

### Scale my business

Working on social issues independently won't be a sustainable move in the long run. For example, I provide [1:1 online mentorship](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/takuyakitazawa) to mentees across the globe, but what if I package the offering as structured educational content? Or, although I've been writing a personal blog for years to share tangible observations and insights [here](/note), I could elevate them as more structured publications for targeted audiences - like the newsletter above. I'm actively seeking such opportunities and eager to collaborate with other businesses. [Contact me](/contact) if you are interested.
