### Promoting equitable access to ICT in Africa

[My one-year assignment as a Canadian international volunteer](https://wusc.akaraisin.com/ui/wuscignitevol/p/tak) now has less than 5 months remaining, and I am actively designing a next step. In particular, working in ICT from one of the poorest countries in the world, I become more interested in [understanding the power dynamics](/note/annual-review-2023/) through the lens of geography, philosophy, and economy with context-awareness in mind. Thus, my top priority is to familiarize myself with the field of [internet geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geography) while compiling my observations in Malawi as a formal publication.

### Living well: Practicing how to eat, workout, and rest more effectively

I am a runner, and my most recent records were [Royal Victoria Marathon](https://startlinetiming.com/en/races/2022/victoriamarathon/view/1007) (3'57) in Oct 2022 and [Ottawa Half Marathon](https://www.sportstats.ca/display-results.xhtml?raceid=118517&status=results&bib=8832) (1'31) in May 2023. The next big milestone is to run a sub-3.5 marathon, hopefully at [Toronto Waterfront Marathon](https://www.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com/) back in Canada. To accomplish this objective, I invest more in being self-disciplined at all costs. As part of practicing, I aim to participate in at least one half-marathon race in sub-Saharan Africa while I'm staying here for volunteer work.

### Accumulating more experience and knowledge in nature

As a resident of the earth, I intentionally spend my spare time in nature as much as possible. When it comes to hiking, I'm an active follower of *[105 Hikes In and Around Southwestern British Columbia](https://105hikes.com/book/),* and I have done 28 hikes out of 105 so far. While I currently live outside of Canada, my passion for outdoor activities remains the same, and my goal is not only to explore as many local sites as possible but to enrich my knowledge and skills further. For example, I have recently upgraded my Canadian Red Cross's Remote First Aid certificate to the advanced Wilderness First Aid certificate. Meanwhile, I recently learned about [scuba diving in Lake Malawi](https://www.padi.com/diving-in/malawi/) and got my PADI Open Water license from [Aqua Africa](https://aquaafrica.co.uk/). In sub-Saharan Africa, traveling to and diving in [Cape Town](https://www.padi.com/diving-in/western-cape/) and [Zanzibar](https://www.padi.com/diving-in/zanzibar/) are the top on my bucket list.
