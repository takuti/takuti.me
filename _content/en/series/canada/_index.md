When I relocated to Canada from Japan for work (in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic), I immediately fell in love with the country, especially for its beautiful nature and rich craft beer culture. Thus, I have seriously built my life and career here for the last couple of years, by changing an employer to one having a greater presence in town, getting a permanent residency, becoming a self-employed business owner, and serving as a Canadian international volunteer. At the same time, as an immigrant, there are a lot of things I have learned from the country's complex history and diverse population. This series tracks my journey to establish life in Canada as a software developer and demonstrates what being a resident of Canada means to us, both culturally and professionally.
