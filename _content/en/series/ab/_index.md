This series started as a [newsletter](https://ab.takuti.me/) to navigate the intersection of technology and society for sustainable impact. Curated from diverse tech-for-good initiatives, the newsletter delivered actionable insights for changemakers seeking to harness digital innovations for meaningful, lasting change.

_As a technologist, I spent two years in [Malawi](/malawi), one of the poorest countries in the world in southeast Africa, from 2023 to 2025. Altruistic Byte is a response to the observations from my firsthand experience, such as cultivating digital literacy among its socio-economically marginalized population as depicted in the picture above._

After its 42nd issue, Altruistic Byte changed the hosting platform to my website (here) for better integration with my blog articles. Although the underlying theme remains the same, you will find more of my personal opinions than objective insights in the broader context of global issues, sustainable development, and impact work. I personally believe these personal touches are more useful in the era of AI.
