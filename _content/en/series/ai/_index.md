As a developer and scientist, I have been working on so-called "AI" technologies ever since my bachelor's thesis. Yet, my experience tells me that the word "AI" implies too many different ideas depending on the context, and over-abstraction makes discussion points ambiguous, if not misleading. Itâ€™s not just a buzzword used for fancy marketing communication. Rather, it is a tangible concept that poses technical, societal, and philosophical challenges. This series attempts to unpack the concept by revealing how it works and why it matters.

_\* To me, the significance of today's AI solutions can be illustrated by sushi - simple presentation yet rich in information once you "taste" it._
