While I was studying recommendation algorithms in my master's program, I happened to know the Julia programming language. It focuses on high-performance scientific computing by utilizing the just-in-time compiler, and I see the programming language can be a great choice for developers to efficiently and effectively pre-process user-item data, build a recommendation model, evaluate a ranked list of recommended contents, and post-process the recommendation if needed. Thereafter, I have been implementing various recommendation techniques in Julia and packaging them as [Recommendation.jl](https://github.com/takuti/Recommendation.jl/).

A paper review process is underway at [JuliaCon/proceedings-review](https://github.com/JuliaCon/proceedings-review/issues/119).
