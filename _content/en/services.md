> **What to expect**: My work is informed by the principles of the [ITIL framework](https://www.peoplecert.org/Frameworks-Professionals/ITIL-framework), which emphasizes solutions grounded in each client's specific context, priorities, and desired outcomes. Hence, I take a collaborative, outcome-focused approach, working closely with you to iteratively shape deliverables through ongoing feedback and shared decision-making. This ensures solutions are practical, sustainable, and aligned with how you actually operate over time.
