## Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Product Developer

I'm passionate about bridging a gap between scientific theory and real-world practice in industry. At [Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com/), an organization building an enterprise-grade big data analytics platform, I have been practically acted as a data scientist, technical evangelist, sales engineer, product manager, machine learning engineer, and software engineer through the experience of contributing to [OSS for scalable ML](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hivemall/), building [out-of-the-box ML application](https://speakerdeck.com/takuti/machine-learning-and-natural-language-processing-on-treasure-cdp), presenting at conferences, and working on a variety of customer-facing opportunities. My current interest is particularly in designing user experience of technologically advanced products in the ML, data science, and IoT domain.
