Hi, I'm takuti.

Until now, this blog had only Japanese articles. However, from this post, __blog.takuti.me__ switches to an English blog. Previous Japanese articles are available here continuously, but I will not write any more Japanese posts. If you want to read my Japanese, you can see it on [my hatenablog](http://takuti.hatenablog.com/), my Japanese blog on one of the most popular blog services in Japan.

Renewed __blog.takuti.me__ may cover following topics:

- Several algorithms in Computer Science field (and their implenetations).
- Applications developed by me.
- Books and web sites which are technologically/scientifically stimulating.

Currently, you can see my implementations and specific applications on [my github repositories](https://github.com/takuti). On this blog, I will explain about them more deeply.

Please send your comments freely! Everything is welcome. Thank you.
