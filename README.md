@takuti's simple portfolio and blogging site generated by [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo).

## Overview

After generating site contents, the contents under *public/* will be deployed to the document root on my remote server.

All of these operations are defined as `rake` commands in Rakefile.

## Dependancies

### System

Hugo and direnv can be installed from homebrew:

```
$ brew install hugo
$ brew install direnv
```

### Ruby Gems

To compile Sass files and Markdown files (including MathJax), we need to get two extra gems:

```
$ gem install sass
$ gem install kramdown
```

## Usage

I should create new contents and Sass files in *_content/* and *_sass/* directories for `rake` commands.

### Generate site and check on my local environment

```
$ rake
```

What this command actually does are:

- [Kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown) converts new Markdown+MathJax contents in *_content/* to html files in *content/*.
- Sass ruby gem converts *_scss/style.scss* files to a css file in *static/*.
- Generate site contents and run Hugo server.

### Deploy generated site contents

By `direnv edit .` command, set environment variables as follows:

```sh
export RSYNC_PROGRAM=/path/to/remote/rsync/program
export RSYNC_DEST_PORT=22
export RSYNC_USER=username
export RSYNC_HOST=example.com
export RSYNC_DEST=/path/to/remote/document/root
```

Complete deploy procedure is:

```
$ rake prepare
$ rake rsync:test
$ rake rsync:sync
```

`rake prepare` command again runs Hugo server to generate site contents with production root url. And, you can finally deploy the contents using `rsync` commands.
